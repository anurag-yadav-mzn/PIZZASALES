This project on Pizza Sales Analysis is created using MySql. This project focuses on analysing pizza sales data for the year 2015. Through this analysis, I have explored various aspects of pizza sales, including the number of orders, revenue generation, and other insightful metrics.

By utilizing SQL, I have been able to extract meaningful insights from the dataset, which consists of detailed information on pizza types, prices, and order quantities. This analysis aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the sales dynamics and performance of different pizza offerings over the course of the year.
